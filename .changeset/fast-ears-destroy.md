Introducing auto prefetching to the `<Link />` component.

There are four supported modes:

-   "in-view": Only prefetch links that are currently visible in the viewport. (recommended)
-   "all": Prefetches all internal links on the page.
-   "hover": Prefetches links on hover.
-   "no": No auto prefetch.

The prefetch mode should be set in `state.theme.autoPrefetch`.
