# Contribute to Silea

We really appreciate your interest to contribute to Silea! Any kind of contribution is highly appreciated, not only coding ☺️.

## Coding Contributions

There is a detailed guide about how to contribute coding at our docs: [Code Contributions](https://docs.sileajs.com/contributing/code-contributions), but if you are looking for a quick guide, these are the main steps:

**Prerequisites:** Node 10 (or newer) installed in your computer.

1. Fork this [repository](https://github.com/sileajs/silea) and clone your fork.
2. Run `npm install` in the root folder.
3. Run `cd examples/mars-theme-example/` to go to the example directory.
4. Run `npx silea dev` to start Silea with mars-theme on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).
5. Make any changes you consider to the packages.
    > **_WARNING: After adding/removing dependencies to a package, go back to the root and do `npm install` again._**
6. Run `npm test` in the root to check if the commit is acceptable.
7. Commit and push to your fork.
8. Open a Pull Request detailing the changes.

> **_WARNING: `npm test` will be run automatically each time your commit or push, so it may take a while. If it fails, it won't let you commit/push. Fix the tests and try again._**

If you get stuck on any of these steps, you should check the [Code Contributions guide](https://docs.sileajs.com/contributing/code-contributions).
